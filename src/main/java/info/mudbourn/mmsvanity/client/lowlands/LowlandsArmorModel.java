/**
 * A worn Clothing of the Lowlands set.
 *
 * <p>The source mod's armour is not vanilla-layout armour art: each set ships a
 * custom {@code EntityModel} with its own texture size (64x64 up to 144x144) and
 * its own UV layout, and the "layer_1/layer_2" PNGs are atlases for <em>that</em>
 * geometry. Feeding them to the vanilla humanoid equipment renderer maps arbitrary
 * texture regions onto vanilla boxes, which is why the asset-only port rendered
 * every set as flat slabs. The geometry has to come across too; this is the base
 * class for it.
 *
 * <p>Part naming is load-bearing. Fabric's {@code Model#copyTransforms} — which is
 * how the worn set inherits the wearer's pose — matches parts <em>by name at any
 * depth</em> against the source model (it builds a recursive name map with
 * {@code putIfAbsent}, so the shallowest part of a given name wins), so the six root
 * parts must carry
 * vanilla {@code HumanoidModel} names ({@code head}, {@code body}, {@code right_arm},
 * {@code left_arm}, {@code right_leg}, {@code left_leg}) rather than the source
 * mod's {@code Head}/{@code Body}/{@code RightArm}/… Every set's extra geometry —
 * brims, pauldrons, coat-tails — is nested <em>beneath</em> those six in the source
 * as well, so it follows the pose for free and needs no per-part relay.
 *
 * <p>{@link #setupAnim} is deliberately empty, and this model is never submitted on
 * its own. It is submitted wrapped in {@link LowlandsArmorPose}, which snapshots the
 * wearer's pose at submit time and replays it here at draw time. The source mod
 * hand-rolled a partial humanoid animation per model, which dropped sneaking and
 * riding; inheriting the real pose is both less code and more correct.

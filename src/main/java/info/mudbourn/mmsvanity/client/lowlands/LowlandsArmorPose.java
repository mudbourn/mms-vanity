/**
 * Poses a Lowlands set from a snapshot of the wearer's pose taken at submit time.
 *
 * <h2>Where the pose comes from</h2>
 *
 * <p>The vanilla armour model for the slot is posed by
 * {@code mixin.cemrelay.HumanoidArmorLayerMixin}, which relays the wearer's CEM
 * animation onto all four slot models at {@code HumanoidArmorLayer#submit}. That
 * runs before {@code renderArmorPiece}, so by the time {@link #of} is called the
 * pose is already there and the whole job is to read it off.
 *
 * <p>{@code source.setupAnim} must <em>not</em> run in the CEM case:
 * {@code HumanoidModel#setupAnim} writes limb angles absolutely, so it would
 * overwrite the relayed pose with a vanilla reconstruction. It is still the floor
 * for a client with no EMF, or a wearer whose base model carries no CEM animation,
 * where the relay is a no-op and nobody else poses {@code source}.
 * {@link CemLayerPoseRelay#isAnimatedCemModel} is the same predicate the relay
 * gates itself on, so the two agree by construction.
 *
 * <h2>Why it is a snapshot and not a copy at draw time</h2>
 *
 * <p>Submission is deferred: {@code submitModel} only collects a node, and
 * {@code ModelFeatureRenderer} calls {@code setupAnim(state)} on the submitted model
 * at end of frame. Earlier versions did the copy there, reading {@code source} — the
 * shared per-slot {@code ArmorModelSet} model — at draw time. Those models are one
 * instance for the whole game, re-posed by every armour-wearing entity that submits
 * after this one and re-posed again by the vanilla draw path, so what got copied was
 * whoever wrote last, not the wearer. The same was true of the wearer's own model,
 * which {@link CemLayerPoseRelay#relayRoot} was reading for the root transform.
 *
 * <p>The result held still while the player did, which is why it looked right at
 * rest, and detached exactly where the pose moves fastest — attack swings and rolls,
 * where one entity's write lands a whole animation's distance from another's.
 *
 * <p>So the pose is read once, into this object, which is live for exactly one piece
 * on one entity for one frame. {@link #setupAnim} then only replays it, and touches
 * no state anything else can write.
 *
 * <h2>Pooling</h2>
 *
 * <p>These are acquired from a per-delegate ring rather than allocated. A fresh
 * instance per piece per entity per frame meant running {@link Model}'s constructor
 * that often, and that constructor walks the delegate's entire part tree to build
 * its part map — twice over, since {@code fabric-rendering-v1} mixes a second walk
 * into it. On a 1.21.11 client that measured at ~3% of the whole render thread with
 * only a handful of armour stands in view, which does not survive a room full of
 * them.
 *
 * <p>The ring is keyed on the delegate because {@link Model}'s root and render type
 * are bound at construction, so a pooled instance belongs to one
 * {@link LowlandsArmorModel} for life. {@link LowlandsArmorSets} hands out one
 * delegate per (asset, slot), so that is the granularity of the ring.
 *
 * <p>{@link #RING} entries per key bounds the pool without needing a frame boundary
 * to reset a cursor on — there is no hook that reliably brackets both the world pass
 * and the inventory/GUI paths that also render armour. The cost of the bound is that
 * a key acquired more than {@code RING} times between a submit and its deferred draw
 * wraps onto a still-pending entry. That takes {@code RING} entities wearing the same
 * set in the same slot on screen at once, and the failure mode is the one the shared
 * delegate already has (see below), not a crash.
 *
 * <h2>Known limit: the delegate is shared</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #setupAnim} writes into {@code delegate.root()}, and the delegate is a
 * singleton per (asset, slot). Two entities wearing the same set in the same slot in
 * one frame therefore draw with whichever posed last, however many distinct pose
 * objects are involved. Pooling neither causes nor worsens this. Fixing it needs a
 * per-wearer delegate instance, which is a separate change.
 *
 * <h2>History</h2>
 *
 * <p>Before 0.9.76 the mixin that diverts the draw here failed to apply at all (see
 * {@code LowlandsArmorPieceMixin}), so none of this code ran and the sets were drawn
 * by the stock equipment renderer. The frozen-armour symptom that motivated
 * {@code relayOver}, and the reasoning built on top of it, were describing a code
 * path that was not executing.

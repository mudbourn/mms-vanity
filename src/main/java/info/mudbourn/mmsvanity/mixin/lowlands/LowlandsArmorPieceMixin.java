/**
 * Draws Clothing of the Lowlands vanity sets with their own geometry.
 *
 * <p>The sets are not vanilla-layout armour: each ships a custom model with its own
 * texture size and UV layout, so the stock humanoid equipment renderer maps their
 * atlases onto vanilla boxes and produces flat slabs. This diverts the draw to the
 * ported model in {@code client.lowlands} while leaving everything else — including
 * every other mod's and vanilla's own armour — on the untouched vanilla path.
 *
 * <p>The dispatch key is the stack's {@code equippable.asset_id}, the same value
 * {@code LowlandsVanity} stamps server-side, so no item registration is needed and
 * the vanilla-leather-plus-components design survives intact. A set that has not
 * been transcribed yet simply is not in the table and falls through to vanilla.
 *
 * <p>Injected at {@code HEAD} of {@code renderArmorPiece}, not {@code submit}: the
 * slot is resolved by this point, and {@code submit} already carries the cemrelay
 * pose mixin, so this stays out of its way. See
 * {@code mixin.cemrelay.HumanoidArmorLayerMixin}.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here poses anything. Submission is deferred, so all posing happens at
 * draw time inside {@link LowlandsArmorPose} — which is the whole reason the first
 * cut rendered frozen armour.
 *
 * <p>The submit call mirrors vanilla's own exactly, substituting only the model:
 * {@code EquipmentLayerRenderer} still resolves the layer textures from the pack's
 * {@code equipment/<asset>.json}, so the inner/outer layer split and the existing
 * ported textures keep working untouched.
